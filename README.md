# Advent of Code 2022 

This repo contains the collection of my attempts at solving the Advent of Code 2022 challenges. I'll be starting by attempting these in Rust, but may add other languages later.

Challenge writeups are available at the Advent of Code website, but I've captured [the descriptions](/docs) and [my input files](/data) in this repo too. (The input files differ per user, so don't try and use them for your own submission!)

Hope you get the chance to figure these out too!
